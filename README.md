## Description
This project implements a Gym-like environment using FCEUX's Lua frontend. The main environment class, defined in `tcp_connection/environment.py`, provides a TCP communication interface with FCEUX and implements the same methods as OpenAI's Gymnasium environments, making it easy to use and extend.

## Usage
Clone the repository into the folder containing your FCEUX executable and run `main.py`.  
Make sure to adjust the paths in `environment.py` beforehand.
